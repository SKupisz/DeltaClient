            What is Delta? It's a cyphering system that will secure your text data like a dream. By the construction of our cypher, final cryptogram could be decrypted as even dozens of results.
            How we are making this that safe? By the cypher structure - during cyphering process, we are using many different mathematic transformations, like integrals, infinitesimal calculus and many others.
            However, the cyphering process is not fixed - we are still adding more and more calculus to that, becuase we believe this will make our cypher stronger.
